    <h3>Re:Albert Momo university application </h3>
    <hr>

    <p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent applications to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study as part of
        your <abbr>PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer all your question one by
        one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h3>Starting dates</h3>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        would start at the beginning of the semester; the start dates for each one are as follow:</p>
    <div>
        First semester: 9 October 2022<br>
        Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
        Third semester: 2 May 2023
    </div>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>

    <h3> Subject of study </h3>

    <p>At Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research faculty - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the
        realm of science and technology.You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person
        we'd like to have on our team.Saying that, one of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as
        follows, in order of priority:
    </p>

    <div>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3.)</sub>Measuring the effect on performance of funk base players as
        temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F),when the audience size exponentially increases (effect
        of 3 <symbol>×</symbol> 10<sup>3</sup> increasing 3 <symbol>×</symbol> 10<sup>4</sup>.)</div>

    <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd
        expect the research to take, required
        staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,
        my favourite dances are as follow, with definitions:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village
            would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>

        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice
            this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling
            their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow
            students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>

        <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
            believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
            movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on
            however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
            cold.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p> For more of my exotic dance research,</p>

    <p> Yours sincerely,</p>
